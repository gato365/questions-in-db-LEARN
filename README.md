# Note Taker Starter Code

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this project was for me to learn how routes work with the back end. What I decided to do was spend time understanding student mini project 28 within the express week to recreate the backend and utilize the front-end code that already existed within this challenge. This diagram shows my thought process:
